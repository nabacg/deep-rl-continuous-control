# deep-rl-continuous-control
This repository contains code demonstrating how to implement Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to solve a Unity ML-Agents environment where a goal is to train an agent to solve the [Reacher environment](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher), where the goal is to control robotic hand by steering it into target location and keep it there. It's a great example of continuous control, where Action space consists of 4 floating point numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints.

Implementation using Python 3, PyTorch, Unity ML-Agents.
